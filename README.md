### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is the Github profile for Alex Cheer (nzgamer41). I hold a BSc(CompSci) from Waikato University, and a Microsoft Office Specialist in Word 2013 qualification. I primarily develop in C#, with some C++ and other similar desktop languages on the side. I have a competent understanding of most programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and Java.

I'm not the most creative person so ideas don't often come naturally to me, but if something interests me I am usually keen to learn and help programming-wise!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any C# project
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C#, ASP.Net, WebSockets in C#
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: hello@alexcheer.tech
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

## PLEASE NOTE
I no longer have a public facing Discord account. Anyone pretending to be nzgamer41 on Discord is not me!
